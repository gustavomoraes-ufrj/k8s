The restart policy of a Job can only be OnFailure or Never.

Upon a container failure, the policy OnFailure will simply rerun the container.

The policy Never does not restart the container upon a failure. It starts a new Pod instead.

By default, a CronJob retains the last three successful Pods and the last failed Pod.
